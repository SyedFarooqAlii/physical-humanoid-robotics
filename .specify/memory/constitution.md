# AI/Spec-Driven Unified Book Creation using Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy through Direct Verification
All factual and technical claims must be verifiable through credible sources. Minimum 60% sources from official documentation, research papers, or authoritative technical platforms. All explanations must be beginner-friendly while remaining technically correct.

### AI-Native Development with Human-in-the-Loop
AI is used as a co-author, not a replacement for human judgment. AI-generated content must be reviewed, edited, and validated by humans. All misleading, biased, or unverifiable content must be removed.

### Reproducibility and Transparency
Reproducibility of content, structure, and workflow. Transparency of sources, tools, and generation process. All content must be written in Markdown. Version control must be maintained via GitHub.

### No Plagiarism or Hallucination
Plagiarism tolerance: 0%. No hallucinated concepts, tools, or references are allowed. All reused ideas must be rewritten originally with proper attribution. Safety, privacy, and responsible AI principles must be respected at all stages.

### Modular and Accessible Content
Clarity and accessibility for a technical audience (students, developers, and AI engineers). Chapters must be modular and independently readable. Each chapter must include concept explanation, practical example, use case or real-world application, and summary.

### Continuous Improvement
Continuous improvement through iterative refinement. All chapters pass human factual verification. Code examples must be runnable, minimal, and clearly explained.

## Technical Constraints
Platform: Docusaurus, Deployment: GitHub Pages, Tooling: Spec-Kit Plus for specification-driven structure and Claude Code for AI-assisted content generation. All content must be written in Markdown. The book must build successfully with zero build errors.

## Development Workflow
Follow Spec-Kit Plus processes for specification-driven development. Use Claude Code for AI-assisted content generation. All chapters must follow a consistent documentation structure defined by Spec-Kit Plus. Each chapter must include concept explanation, practical example, use case or real-world application, and summary.

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and migration plan if needed. All development must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity must be justified. Use CLAUDE.md for runtime development guidance.
