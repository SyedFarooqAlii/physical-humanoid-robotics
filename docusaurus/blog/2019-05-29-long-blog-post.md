This blog post shares my journey as a Web3 & AI enthusiast and full-stack developer from Pakistan, learning about the fascinating world of humanoid robotics and artificial intelligence.

I'm currently learning from Governor's IT Initiative for Web 3.0 Developer, Gen AI & Metaverse, and I'm excited to share my experiences and knowledge with the robotics community. My passion for advancing the field of robotics and AI drives me to create educational resources like this Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics curriculum.

Currently, I'm working on multiple TypeScript projects and constantly learning advanced programming concepts. Robotics and AI represent the future, and I'm committed to contributing to this exciting field through continuous learning and development.

You can explore all my projects on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/SyedFarooqAlii) and connect with me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/syed-farooq-ali-8328b4267). Feel free to reach out to me at syedfarooqali15@gmail.com with any questions or feedback about this curriculum.
