Explore how modern documentation tools like Docusaurus can enhance robotics education using MDX features. This demonstrates the power of combining React components with Markdown for interactive learning experiences.

:::tip

Use the power of React to create interactive robotics tutorials and documentation.

For example, use JSX to create an interactive robotics simulator visualization:

```js
<button onClick={() => alert('Robot activated!')}>Start Robot!</button>
```

<button onClick={() => alert('Robot activated!')}>Start Robot!</button>

This interactive approach helps students better understand complex robotics concepts through hands-on experimentation with the curriculum materials.
