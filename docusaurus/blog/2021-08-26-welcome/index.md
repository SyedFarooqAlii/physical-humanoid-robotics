Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics curriculum! This comprehensive educational resource combines my passion for Web3, AI, and robotics to provide you with cutting-edge knowledge in humanoid robotics development.

<!-- truncate -->

As a full-stack developer from Pakistan currently learning through Governor's IT Initiative for Web 3.0 Developer, Gen AI & Metaverse, I've created this curriculum to share knowledge about:

- Advanced ROS 2 communication systems
- Digital twin technologies using Gazebo and Unity
- AI integration with NVIDIA Isaac platforms
- Vision-Language-Action systems for multimodal robotics

The curriculum is structured in four comprehensive modules, each designed to build upon the previous knowledge to create a complete understanding of humanoid robotics systems.

I'm constantly working on multiple TypeScript projects and learning advanced programming concepts. Robotics and AI represent the future, and I'm committed to contributing to this exciting field through educational resources like this one.
