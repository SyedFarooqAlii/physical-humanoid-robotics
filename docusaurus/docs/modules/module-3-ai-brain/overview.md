# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

## Overview
Module 3 focuses on the AI-Robot Brain system using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS, bridging the gap between low-level robot control and high-level cognitive functions. This module covers essential AI/ML concepts for robotics, including perception, planning, and control using Isaac libraries. Students will learn to implement intelligent behaviors that enable robots to understand their environment, make decisions, and execute complex tasks.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this module, students will be able to:
- Implement perception pipelines using Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS
- Design planning algorithms for autonomous robot behavior
- Create control systems for precise robot manipulation
- Integrate AI models with robotic systems using NVIDIA Isaac tools
- Validate AI-driven robot behaviors in simulation and reality
- Optimize AI algorithms for real-time robot operation

## Module Structure
This module consists of four chapters covering essential aspects of AI-robot integration:

1. **Chapter 3-1: Isaac Sim Basics** - Introduction to NVIDIA Isaac Sim for AI-robot development
2. **Chapter 3-2: Perception Pipelines** - Implementing computer vision and sensor processing
3. **Chapter 3-3: Planning Algorithms** - Designing autonomous decision-making systems
4. **Chapter 3-4: Control Systems** - Implementing precise robot control and manipulation

## Prerequisites
Before starting this module, students should have:
- Basic understanding of machine learning and neural networks
